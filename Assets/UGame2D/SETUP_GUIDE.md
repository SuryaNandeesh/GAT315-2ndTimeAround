# Metroidvania Game Setup Guide

## üéÆ Manual Level Building Mode

**Procedural generation is now DISABLED by default.** This allows you to manually design and build your own custom levels using the provided prefabs and tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Manual Building

1. **Open the Scene**: Load `Assets/UGame2D/Scenes/MetroidvaniaMain.unity`
2. **Your Canvas**: The scene contains only essential objects:
   - Main Camera (orthographic, size 20)
   - GameManager (handles game state)
   - UIManager (creates top-left HUD automatically)
   - WorldBuilder (disabled but available for reference)
   - Player (spawned at origin 0,0,0)

3. **Start Building**: Drag prefabs from the project to create your level!

## üèóÔ∏è Manual Level Building

### Available Prefabs
Located in `Assets/UGame2D/Prefabs/`:
- **Platform.prefab**: Basic platform elements
- **Ground.prefab**: Ground/floor tiles  
- **Enemy.prefab**: Enemy characters with AI
- **Player.prefab**: Player character (already in scene)
- **Collectibles**: Energy tanks, health pickups, ability orbs, score items

### WorldBuilder Tools
The WorldBuilder component has useful tools available via right-click context menu:

#### Context Menu Options:
- **Generate World**: Enable procedural generation temporarily to create a base level
- **Clear Generated World**: Remove all procedurally generated objects
- **Spawn Player Only**: Spawn just the player at origin (useful if deleted)

### Building Your Level

1. **Layout the Foundation**:
   ```
   - Place Ground prefabs for floors and platforms
   - Use Platform prefabs for jumping challenges
   - Position at strategic locations for gameplay flow
   ```

2. **Add Enemies**:
   ```
   - Drag Enemy prefabs into the scene
   - Each enemy will automatically get random AI behavior
   - Place them on platforms or patrol areas
   ```

3. **Place Collectibles**:
   ```
   - Energy Tank prefabs: Permanent health upgrades
   - Health Pickup prefabs: Temporary healing
   - Ability Pickup prefabs: Unlock movement abilities
   - Score Item prefabs: Point-based rewards
   ```

4. **Test and Iterate**:
   ```
   - Press Play to test your level
   - Use the beautiful top-left HUD to monitor progress
   - Adjust platform positions for difficulty balance
   ```

## üéõÔ∏è WorldBuilder Settings

In the WorldBuilder component, you can:

### Enable/Disable Procedural Generation
- **enableProceduralGeneration**: Set to `true` to use automatic generation
- **Default**: `false` for manual building

### Reference Dimensions
- **worldWidth**: 200 units (for reference)
- **worldHeight**: 120 units (for reference)  
- **roomSize**: 80x60 units (suggested room dimensions)

### Prefab References
All prefab slots are pre-configured for easy dragging:
- **platformPrefab**: Platform elements
- **groundPrefab**: Ground tiles
- **enemyPrefab**: Enemy characters
- **collectible prefabs**: Various pickup types

## üé® Level Design Tips

### Camera Considerations
- **Orthographic Size**: 20 units (shows large area)
- **Player Movement**: Design around player's abilities
- **Visibility**: Ensure important elements are visible on screen

### Platform Spacing
- **Horizontal**: 4-8 units apart for jumping challenges
- **Vertical**: 6-12 units for different difficulty levels
- **Ability Gates**: Design areas requiring specific abilities

### Enemy Placement
- **Patrol Areas**: Give enemies clear paths to walk
- **Guard Points**: Place near important collectibles
- **Chasers**: In open areas where they can pursue effectively

### Collectible Strategy
- **Energy Tanks**: Hidden or challenging locations
- **Health Pickups**: Before/after difficult sections
- **Abilities**: Gate progression, place strategically
- **Score Items**: Reward exploration

## üîß Advanced Manual Building

### Using Inspector for Precise Placement
1. **Select objects** in scene hierarchy
2. **Transform component** shows exact position
3. **Snap to grid**: Hold Ctrl while moving for alignment
4. **Duplicate**: Ctrl+D to copy positioned objects

### Creating Rooms Manually
1. **Define boundaries** with Ground prefabs
2. **Add platforms** at various heights
3. **Place 3-5 enemies** per room area
4. **Distribute collectibles** strategically
5. **Test connectivity** between areas

### Layer Management
- **Default**: Most game objects
- **Player**: Player character
- **Enemy**: Enemy characters  
- **Collectible**: Pickup items
- **Platform**: Ground and platform elements

## üéÆ Testing Your Level

### Pre-Flight Checklist
‚úÖ Player spawned at reasonable starting location  
‚úÖ Ground platforms provide clear paths  
‚úÖ Enemies placed on accessible platforms  
‚úÖ Collectibles distributed throughout level  
‚úÖ No floating objects or gaps that break progression  
‚úÖ Camera size (20) provides good view of level  

### Testing Process
1. **Press Play** in Unity
2. **Move around** with WASD/Arrow keys
3. **Jump** with Spacebar
4. **Collect items** to test progression
5. **Observe UI** - health, score, timer in top-left
6. **Check enemy behavior** - patrol, guard, chase patterns

### Iterative Design
- **Play frequently** during building
- **Adjust spacing** based on player movement
- **Balance difficulty** with strategic collectible placement
- **Ensure exploration rewards** with hidden items

## üèÜ Level Design Goals

### Core Metroidvania Elements
- **Interconnected areas** accessible via different routes
- **Ability-gated progression** requiring specific powers
- **Hidden secrets** rewarding thorough exploration  
- **Balanced challenge** with health/upgrade management

### Technical Goals
- **Smooth performance** with reasonable object counts
- **Clear visual hierarchy** using positioning and spacing
- **Intuitive navigation** with visual landmarks
- **Reward discovery** with well-placed collectibles

## üîÑ Converting to Procedural (Optional)

If you want to switch back to procedural generation:

1. **Select WorldBuilder** in hierarchy
2. **Check "Enable Procedural Generation"** in inspector  
3. **Press Play** - world generates automatically
4. **Use "Clear Generated World"** context menu to reset

## üìö Resources

### Unity 2D Documentation
- [2D Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Physics2D.html)
- [Sprite Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html)
- [Tilemap System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Tilemap.html)

### Level Design Principles  
- **Flow**: Guide player movement naturally
- **Pacing**: Alternate challenge and relief
- **Clarity**: Make interactable elements obvious
- **Rewards**: Balance risk and reward appropriately

*Happy level building! Create the metroidvania world of your dreams with complete creative control.*

## Controls
- **WASD/Arrow Keys**: Move
- **Spacebar**: Jump
- **Shift/X**: Dash (when unlocked)
- **Escape**: Pause
- **R**: Restart (when game over)

## What You'll See
- **6 procedurally generated rooms** connected by platforms
- **Enemies** with different AI behaviors patrolling areas
- **Collectible items** scattered throughout the world
- **Physics interactions** like springs and moving platforms
- **Ability progression** - collect abilities to unlock new movement options

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing Prefab" Errors:**
- Make sure all prefabs are assigned in the WorldBuilder component
- Create simple placeholder prefabs if needed (just colored cubes work)

**Player Falls Through Ground:**
- Check that Ground prefabs have Box Collider 2D components
- Ensure Ground layer is set correctly in enemy AI ground detection

**No UI Visible:**
- The scene needs a Canvas with UI elements
- For now, the game will work without UI (check Console for score updates)

**Compilation Errors:**
- Make sure all scripts are in the `Assets/UGame2D/Scripts/` folder
- Check that no duplicate class names exist with existing project scripts

## Next Steps
1. **Add Sprites**: Replace colored rectangles with actual 2D sprites
2. **Create UI**: Add Canvas with health bars, score display, etc.
3. **Add Audio**: Assign audio clips to the GameManager audio sources
4. **Customize Levels**: Modify the WorldBuilder parameters for different layouts
5. **Add Animations**: Create Animator Controllers for character animations
