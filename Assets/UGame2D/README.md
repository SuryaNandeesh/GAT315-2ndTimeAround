## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open Scene**: Load `Assets/UGame2D/Scenes/MetroidvaniaMain.unity`
2. **Manual Building**: Drag prefabs to create your custom level (procedural generation disabled)
3. **Movement**: WASD/Arrow keys + Spacebar to jump
4. **Abilities**: Collect ability orbs to unlock Double Jump (C), Dash (X), Wall Jump
5. **Objective**: Build, test, and iterate on your custom metroidvania level

## 🎮 Controls

- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Jump**: Spacebar
- **Double Jump**: C (after unlocking)
- **Dash**: X (after unlocking)
- **Pause**: Escape

## 🔧 Customization

### Manual Level Building
- **enableProceduralGeneration**: Set to `false` for manual building (default)
- **Prefab References**: All building blocks available in WorldBuilder component
- **Room Dimensions**: Use 80x60 unit guidelines for consistent room sizes
- **Context Menus**: Right-click WorldBuilder for "Generate World", "Clear World", "Spawn Player Only"

### UI Appearance
