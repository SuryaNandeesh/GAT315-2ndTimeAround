# 2D Game World Assignment - Setup Guide

## Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Open the Project
1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click "Open" and select this project folder

4. Open the scene: `Assets/Scenes/Unity2DWorld.unity`

### 2. Run the Demo
**The scene is already set up and ready to run!**
1. Press the Play button in Unity
2. The level will automatically build with all prefabs placed
3. Use WASD/Arrow keys to move, Space to jump
4. Collect coins, avoid spikes, and find health pickups

### 3. Optional: Add Demo Components
1. Create an empty GameObject and add `DemoSceneManager` for UI feedback
2. Create another empty GameObject and add `GameWorldDemo` for feature showcase

## Assignment Requirements Checklist

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Tilemap System

- [x] TilemapCollider2D for physics interactions
- [x] Varied terrain with platforms and ground tiles

#### 2. Collectible Prefabs (2+ different types)
- [x] **Coin Prefab**: Point-based collectible with rotation animation
- [x] **Health Pickup Prefab**: Restores player health
- [x] Trigger colliders for interaction detection
- [x] Visual feedback and proper cleanup on collection

#### 3. Hazard Prefabs (1+ damage-dealing)
- [x] **Spike Hazard Prefab**: Deals damage on contact
- [x] Uses spike sprite from provided tileset
- [x] Trigger collider with damage system integration
- [x] Optional continuous damage capability

#### 4. Physics Integration
- [x] All prefabs use appropriate 2D colliders
- [x] Player has Rigidbody2D for realistic movement
- [x] Trigger vs. collision separation (collectibles/hazards vs. platforms)
- [x] Ground detection using OverlapBox

#### 5. Strategic Level Design
- [x] Thoughtful placement encouraging exploration
- [x] Risk vs. reward positioning of items
- [x] Varied difficulty with accessible and challenging areas
- [x] Health pickups near danger zones

#### 6. Additional Features (Beyond Requirements)
- [x] Advanced player controller with modern platformer mechanics
- [x] Coyote time and jump buffering
- [x] Variable jump height
- [x] Health system integration
- [x] Visual debugging and gizmos
- [x] Automated level building system
- [x] Demo UI and validation systems

## Controls

### Player Movement
- **Movement**: A/D keys or Left/Right arrows
- **Jump**: Space, W, or Up arrow
- **Variable Jump**: Hold for higher jumps, tap for shorter jumps

### Demo Controls
- **R**: Reset level (rebuild all prefabs)
- **I**: Show feature information in console

## Testing the Assignment

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Press Play
2. Use WASD/Arrows to move the blue player character
3. Jump with Space to test physics
4. Collect yellow coins (should disappear and log collection)
5. Touch red health pickups (should restore health)
6. Touch gray spikes (should deal damage)

### 2. Physics Validation
- Player should fall with gravity
- Player should land on green tilemap platforms
- Collectibles should trigger without blocking movement
- Hazards should damage but not block movement
- Slopes should be traversable

### 3. Level Design Evaluation
- Items should be strategically placed
- Some collectibles should require jumping to reach
- Hazards should create meaningful obstacles
- Level should encourage exploration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Player Falls Through Ground
- Check that tilemap has TilemapCollider2D component
- Verify ground layer mask in PlayerController2D matches tilemap layer

#### Collectibles Don't Work
- Ensure prefabs have "Collectible" tag
- Check that CircleCollider2D is set as "Is Trigger"
- Verify player has "Player" tag

#### Spikes Don't Damage
- Ensure spike prefabs have "Hazard" tag
- Check that player has Health component
- Verify BoxCollider2D is set as "Is Trigger"

#### Level Doesn't Build
- Check all prefab references are assigned in GameManager's LevelBuilder
- Ensure scene has Grid and Tilemap components
- Try manually calling "Build Level" from context menu

### Performance Tips
- Use object pooling for collectibles in larger levels
- Combine tilemap chunks for better performance
- Adjust physics timestep if movement feels sluggish

## Extending the Assignment

### Easy Additions
- Add sound effects to collectibles and hazards
- Create particle effects for collections
- Add more collectible types (gems, power-ups)
- Design additional hazard types (moving spikes, fire)

### Advanced Extensions
- Implement enemy AI characters
- Add level progression and save system
- Create animated sprite characters
- Build level editor tools
- Add background parallax scrolling
